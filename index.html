        <h2> What is our goal?</h2>
        <p> We wanted to create a space for women to feel 
        comfortable learning how to invest. We hope that after visiting
        our website, we have encouraged more women to start investing!</p>

        <h2> Why should I start investing?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Research shows that women are more likely to be discouraged from
          investing than men.</li>
          <p> UK-based digital banking company Starling Bank analyzed 300 articles, 
          and found that “women were defined as "excessive spenders" across 65% of 
          the articles aimed at them”, and were “advised to “limit, restrict, and take 
          better control of shopping 'splurges'. </p>

          <li> Second Bullet thingy</li>
          <p>In one study, 65% of financial articles aimed at women told them that they are 
          "excessive spenders." They encouraged women to find bargains and coupons and control 
          splurges. Articles aimed at men told them to dare to invest and spend to increase their
          power.
